This project is about creating the 2D snake game which was famous with the Nokia 3XXX series phones from the early 2000's

The project is build using OOPs concepts. There are 4 classes all of which gets called from the "main.py"
snake class - this is the heart of the game and deails everything about how the snake is created, how its body 
              is managed, all the different moves that a snake does is captured in this class.
scoreboard class - this takes care of maintaining the player score.
food class - this is the food which the snake consumes and grows in length.
gameover class - this takes care of feedback to the user when snake collides with its own body or the screen walls

main - this program handles all the above classes in a way which completes the games.
