COFFEE Machine simulation is a program which mimicks how a coffee machine behaves.
This program simulates
  1. Giving options to the user about their drink choices,
  2. Validates if there are enough resources within the machine to make the drink
  3. Its a coin operated machine so it gives options to the user to insert coins. Calculates the respective value
  4. If enough coin is presented then it goes ahead and delivers the drink.
  5. It also has options to generate "report" which can help check the current state of resouces within the machine
  6. Also, a OFF option to turn it off for maintenance 😀😁
