This program is built to help all those who miss out on wishing Birthday to people close to them ðŸ˜‚
The program uses smtp lib from Python and uses google mail servers to send the emails on a given day based on
  the list from "birthday.csv"
The program also has sample letter templates which can be used to randomly pick a template and use that to send the email.
This program is hosted on "pythonanywhere.com" (https://www.pythonanywhere.com/user/rameshplakkal/tasks_tab/) 
  and scheduled to run on a daily basis to validate birth day and trigger the emails.
